# Local Coding Agent — MCP server

A local MCP server that ChatGPT Web (or any MCP client) connects to as a tool.
It lets the model act like a coding agent on **your own machine** — read/write
files, run commands, manage background processes, and use git — confined to
folders you configure. It does **not** use an API key and does **not** automate
ChatGPT sessions; it is a normal MCP connector you authorize.

> Full documentation, security model, and setup: see the [repository README](../README.md).

## Tools

| Group | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Info | `workspace_info`, `ping` |
| Read | `repo_overview`, `list_files`, `find_files`, `read_file`, `read_many` (concurrent + line ranges), `stat_path`, `search_text` (ripgrep/git, with context + glob), `workspace_search` (multi-project `@` autocomplete) |
| Figma Desktop | `figma_status`, `figma_list_tools`, `figma_call_tool`, `figma_get_design_context`, `figma_get_screenshot`, `figma_get_metadata`, `figma_get_variable_defs`, `figma_get_code_connect_map`, `figma_get_figjam` |
| Write | `write_file`, `replace_in_file`, `apply_patch`, `make_dir`, `move_path`, `delete_path` |
| Execute | `run_command`, `run_commands` (bounded batch; cmd/powershell/bash/sh/zsh) |
| Processes | `proc_start`, `proc_list`, `proc_output`, `proc_stop` |
| Git | `git` |
| Pro | `workspace_snapshot`, `workspace_doctor`, `repo_map`, `repo_symbols`, `review_diff`, `session_report` |
| Manual verification | `detect_test_commands`, `quality_gate`, `run_tests`, `run_build`, `run_lint`, `run_changed_tests` |
| Notes & session | `save_note`, `list_notes`, `checkpoint`, `resume` |

## Run

Recommended flow from any project repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
lca
```

Low-level server-only run:

```bash
cd server
npm install
# minimum: point it at a folder you want the agent to work in
#   Windows PowerShell:  $env:AGENT_WORKSPACE="<path-to-your-repo>"
#   bash:                export AGENT_WORKSPACE="/path/to/your/repo"
npm start
```

- MCP endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8789/mcp`
- Health: `http://127.0.0.1:8789/healthz`

## Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `PORT` | `8789` | HTTP port for the MCP endpoint. |
| `AGENT_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. Keep loopback; the tunnel forwards to it. |
| `AGENT_WORKSPACE` | `../agent-workspace` | Primary root the agent may touch. |
| `AGENT_EXTRA_ROOTS` | _(empty)_ | Extra roots, `;`-separated. |
| `AGENT_EXTRA_ROOTS_JSON` | _(empty)_ | Extra roots as a JSON string array. Prefer this for paths that contain separators. |
| `AGENT_MODE` | `safe` | Command guardrail. `safe` = conservative blocklist; `full` = fewer app-level command blocks. Not an OS sandbox. |
| `AGENT_POLICY` | `balanced` | Tool policy. `strict` = read-only; `balanced` = local approval for risky actions; `full` = no policy approval gate. |
| `AGENT_ALLOW_DANGEROUS` | _(unset)_ | `1` allows even catastrophic system commands. Leave unset. |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | _(empty)_ | If set, every `/mcp` request must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | _(empty)_ | Trusted browser origins for `/mcp`. Empty rejects browser-origin MCP calls. |
| `AGENT_APPROVAL_TOKEN` | _(empty)_ | Secret for token-based approval tools. In `policy=balanced`, set this to approve risky actions without switching to `policy=full`. |
| `AGENT_APPROVAL_TTL_MINUTES` | `10` | Exact approval expiry, clamped to 1-30 minutes. |
| `AGENT_AUDIT` | `1` | Set `0` to disable audit logging for maximum hot-path speed. |
| `AGENT_AUDIT_ARGS` | `1` | Set `0` to keep audit events but skip argument serialization/redaction. |
| `AGENT_HTTP_LOG` | `0` | Set `1` to print every HTTP request. Disabled by default to keep tunnel traffic quiet. |
| `AGENT_MAX_BATCH_READ_CHARS` | `500000` | Combined text cap for one `read_many` response. |
| `AGENT_READ_DEFAULT` | `30000` | Default chars `read_file` returns (raise per-call via `max_chars`). Keeps payloads + context small. |
| `AGENT_CMD_OUTPUT_DEFAULT` | `20000` | Default chars of command output returned (use `tail_lines`/`head_lines`/`max_output_chars`). |
| `FIGMA_DESKTOP_MCP_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp` | Official local MCP endpoint exposed by Figma Desktop after enabling it in Dev Mode. |
| `FIGMA_DESKTOP_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Timeout for connecting to or calling the Figma Desktop MCP server. |
| `FIGMA_DESKTOP_ALLOW_REMOTE` | `0` | Set `1` only to allow a non-loopback override. The official desktop endpoint is loopback. |

`ripgrep` (`rg`) is auto-installed by `lca setup` when a supported package
manager is available. It is not required, but `search_text`, `find_files`, and
repo mapping are much faster with it.

Fast workflow note: test/build/lint tools are kept for explicit manual use, but
`workspace_snapshot` and default guidance do not recommend running them
automatically.

## Test

```bash
npm run test:agent       # exercises every tool against a running server
npm run test:security    # runtime security checks against a running server
npm run test:hardening   # self-contained policy/origin/body/undo regressions
npm run test:pro         # Pro snapshot/report/tier regression checks
npm run test:figma       # mocked Figma Desktop MCP bridge checks
```
